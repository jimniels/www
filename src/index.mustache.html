        <em>Who are you?</em> “I am a designer who codes” is likely the answer
        you’re looking for, but what I do is solve problems and add value. That
        said, I’m so much more than my job but this is a website where I talk
        about myself professionally so I have to say these kinds of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What are your skills?</em> I design visual interfaces and leverage
        principles of design, color theory, and typography. I write code and
        intimately understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But my skills are tools
        to an end: to solve problems and add value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What’s your expertise?</em> My expertise lies in synthesizing
        knowledge across traditionally disparate boundaries. “Visual designer”,
        “Front-end Developer”, and “Product Manager” are all responsibilities I
        assume in order to add value to a business, to enhance a company’s
        culture, to bring clarity to a project, or to just get along with humans
        (a task often perceived as a difficult for people who write instructions
        for machines).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How are you, you know, as a human?</em> Don’t take it from me, here
        are the words of a peer when I was departing a previous employer: “Gonna
        be a real bummer here w/o you. You bring a lot of great design, and a
        lot of not-being-an-asshole-ness.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Do you have anything else to say?</em> I do. Glad you asked.
        Everything I am—as a designer, developer, really just a human—is a
        result of the wonderful people who I’ve crossed paths with in my life.
        In technology in particular, I’ve worked with some of the most
        <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdary" title="Jen">inpsiring</a>,

        and <a href="https://tylergaw.com" title="the gaw">sincere</a> people
        you’ll ever meet—and I didn’t use the word “talented” because they all
        are! More than any project, I’m proud of the people I’ve worked with and
        learned from. I look forward to crossing paths with you someday too,
        dear reader.

        I enjoy the practice writing because it is a form of seeking clarity to
        me. That said, I don’t believe a lot of the things I’ve written about in
        the past. Why? Because I’ve learned a lot through both writing and
        direct experience and the more you learn, the more your beliefs evolve.
        It is inevitable. If you believe the same things you believed ten years
        ago, I would suggest that you haven’t really learned anything. New
        knowledge causes me to reassess my beliefs. The more knowledge you have,
        the broader your perspective is, and the more clearly you see contexts
        and relationships between truth and error. It’s like your designs from
        years ago. You squirm when you look at them. Why? Because your
        understanding and knowledge and aesthetics have changed and evolved over
        the years. That’s how I feel about my writing.</p> -->

        know what I think I know.

      <h2>My Blog</h2>

      <p>
        I started blogging circa 2008—those first few years being nonsensical
        and ephemeral—and guess what? I’m still trying to find my voice.

      <p>
        @TODO Growing up, my Mom always pies. At the time, I didn’t know they
        were <em>the best</em> pies. As I grew into my teenage years, I began to
        notice that I didn’t enjoy eating pies from a restaurant or store like
        all the other kids. Those weren’t real pies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my mid-twenties, I moved to New York City and figured if I could buy
        a good pie anywhere in the world, surely I could in NYC. Alas, I still
        found myself wanting for a good pie like Mama used to make. So, I
        figured, if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked my Mom for her recipe and began making my own pies. So while my
        pie obsession was born out of a drive to <em>eat</em> good pie, now it’s
        just as much composed of a desire to <em>make</em> a good pie. Making is
        now half the fun!

        designer anymore—let alone I don’t have anything that fancy, I dono’t do
        it much anymore. That’s not to say I don’t filnd the stuff from the past
        stilll interesting! So i keep it here for nostalgia. Honestly, rather
        than dribbble, I’d rather just play basketball.

        <a href="https://logo-integrity.jim-nielsen.com">Logo Integrity</a>: a
        visual experiment turned game based on ubiquitos logos.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <em>A Designer’s Art</em>, Paul Rand asks: “How far out of focus can
        an image be and still be recognized?” He proposes that a well-designed
        logo retains its form and recognizability under the duress of real-world
        use and abuse. For fun, I decided to subject some contemporary logos to
        a form of visual stress and see how well people still recognized them.

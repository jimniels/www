  excerpt: Interfacing with an API is a big part of web development and design these
    days. APIs help provide a rich, dynamic experience in the browser. Rather than
    static markup and images, you can dynamically push and pull data from a server
    and render it in the browser based on the experience you want to provide for the
    user. In this tutorial, we’ll look at how to build an API-driven app.

  excerpt: 'HTML is at the core of the web. Sometimes, in the pursuit of making things
    look beautiful using CSS, we forget that. If you’ve ever used Sass (or a CSS compiler
    in general), you’ve probably seen your site’s styles break due to a compile error.
    But before you rush to fix the error you just introduced, take this as an opportunity
    to analyze and enhance the core of your site: the HTML.'

  excerpt: One popular navigation design pattern for the responsive web is collapsing
    your website’s navigation into a select menu. However, representing hierarchy
    or categorical distinctions in select elements often leads to butchered HTML with
    manual hyphens and lots of &nbsp; spaces. In this tutorial we’ll introduce you
    to a somehwat obscure HTML tag called optgroup which will provide you with an

  excerpt: Achieving pixel perfection when designing UI elements can be simple thanks
    to Photoshop’s “snap to pixels” feature. Unfortunately, this feature is not available
    for the ellipse tool – creating crisp, pixel-perfect circles can therefore require
    additional attention to detail. I’m going to let you in on a little secret which
    will make “snap to pixels” available when creating circles.
